      <h2>How We Started</h2>
      <p>
        NutriCrate began in 2024 when a small group of college fitness lovers
        realized how hard it was to find new supplements without buying huge
        tubs or full cases. What started as a dorm-room idea—sharing sample
        packs and rating them for fun—grew into a passion project to connect
        people with products that actually work for their lifestyle. We launched
        NutriCrate to make discovery easy, affordable, and fun again.

      <h2>Where We’re Headed</h2>
      <p>
        As we grow, our goal is to partner with more brands, expand our
        selection to include hydration, vitamins, and recovery products, and
        build a personalized recommendation engine so each box feels made just
        for you. We’re also working on integrating sustainable packaging and
        carbon-neutral shipping to make every delivery a little better for the
        planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re chasing PRs at the gym or just trying to stay energized
        through the day, NutriCrate is here to help you <em>fuel up and feel
        great</em>.
